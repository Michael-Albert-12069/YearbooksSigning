    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>
            The only acceptable way to setup an account on our platform is to use the provided methods (ie. Google, etc) any other detected breach of privacy will be noted, and will be punished. Given that this is a free service, any sort of hacking done will be dealt with by Github.com and Google.com.

    <p>
            We will not tolerate any form of cyberbullying, your messages will be tracked to your google account, and any form of cyberbullying will result in both banning from the site, and reporting to Google.com which can result in termination of your google account based on the nature of the cyberbullying.

            Please avoid posting large messages, I am poor, and cannot afford enterprize grade servers, once we hit 10GB of messages (unlikely) I reserve the right to delete messages as I see fit.

        And Finally, Have Fun! Coronavirus has taken school from us, but it won't and cannot take away from our yearbook signing experience :)
